# CircleCI and fastlane Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the iOS build for CircleCI using fastlane.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Permission errors during gem installation**
   - Solution: Configured bundler to install gems locally using `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'`
   - This prevents permission issues when installing gems on CI environments

2. **Missing Appfile**
   - Solution: Created a fastlane/Appfile with proper configuration
   - This file tells fastlane about your app's bundle identifier and team ID

3. **Code signing configuration**
   - Solution: Added support for both App Store Connect API and match-based code signing
   - Updated the Fastfile to handle different code signing approaches

4. **Deployment script improvements**
   - Solution: Created dedicated deploy scripts for iOS and Android
   - These scripts handle environment setup, key conversion, and cleanup

5. **CircleCI configuration updates**
   - Solution: Updated the CircleCI config to use the new deployment scripts
   - Added CocoaPods installation step for iOS builds
   - Improved caching configuration

## Files Created/Modified

1. **fastlane/Appfile** - Added app identifier and team ID configuration
2. **fastlane/Matchfile** - Added match configuration for code signing
3. **fastlane/deploy-ios.sh** - Created deployment script for iOS
4. **fastlane/deploy-android.sh** - Created deployment script for Android
5. **fastlane/Fastfile** - Updated to improve code signing and workspace detection
6. **.circleci/config.yml** - Updated to use local gem installation and deployment scripts
7. **IOS_CIRCLECI_SETUP.md** - Created step-by-step guide for iOS setup
8. **CIRCLECI_FASTLANE_SETUP.md** - Created comprehensive guide for CircleCI and fastlane

## Environment Variables Required

### For iOS builds:
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
- `APP_IDENTIFIER`: Your app's bundle identifier
- `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_CONTENT`: App Store Connect API credentials
- Or `FASTLANE_USER`, `FASTLANE_PASSWORD`: Apple ID credentials
- `MATCH_GIT_URL`, `MATCH_PASSWORD`: If using match for code signing

### For Android builds:
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded Android keystore file
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Password for the keystore
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: Key alias in the keystore
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for the key
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY`: Google Play Store service account key

## Next Steps

1. Set up all required environment variables in CircleCI project settings
2. For iOS code signing, either:
   - Set up match with a private Git repository, or
   - Configure manual code signing with provisioning profiles
3. Run a test build to verify the configuration
4. If issues persist, refer to the troubleshooting section in IOS_CIRCLECI_SETUP.md
